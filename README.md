# PythonTutorials
You will find a possible solution for every excercise in aufgaben/ in loesungen/. Also, the naming of files in both directories is nearly identical, so you may find specific ones easily.

The files in tutorial_code/ are meant to be read, since they contain typical constructs and are heavily commented, just as most solutions in loesungen/ are. There, you will also find a cheatsheet containing basic language features of python3.

We hope this helps you learn a pretty noice language \:D
